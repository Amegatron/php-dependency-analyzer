# PHP Dependency Analyzer
=========================

This library is meant to help analyze dependencies in a PHP project. Currently, it's a very draft version
to just help me solve my tasks on-demand. But I believe I'll anyway continue developing it to better suit my
own needs cause there aren't actually any other tools that suite me enough (either outdated or too specific).
